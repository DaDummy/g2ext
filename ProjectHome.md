Usually, modifications of the engine of a game are literally impossible (for most mortal people at least...).
Unfortunatelly, this is also the case with the engine of Gothic II TNotR. The ZenGin.<br />
There are lots of people, that want to modify the engine, so that their mods have unique features which are not being limited by a more or less _very simple_ script system and a load of bugs. Unfortunatelly they mostly lack of the needed programming and the essential reverse engineering skills.

To do at least a little bit against that problem and to open up the engine to the modders to create at least simple engine modifications, we have created _G2Ext_.

G2Ext features a set of the most important headers and a loader which loads and executes the mod dlls.
It is also planned to give it some "new features" (f.e new sound system, etc.), but that is another story.

<b>Important:</b>
The G2Ext binaries require the <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en'>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable</a> package to be installed on your PC.<br />(The package is included to the G2Ext installer.)
