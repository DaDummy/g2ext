 *
 * @section faq_11 What is G2Ext?
 *
 * G2Ext is a engine modding toolkit for "Gothic II - The Night of the Raven" (v2.6_fix). It is using dll-injection to get the engine plugins working.
 * This means, that you can (more or less) freely implement new features into the engine and influence the working cycle of the engine.
 * There are thousands of possibilities. What you do is up to you.
 *
 * @section faq_12 Where can I get the required Gothic2.exe (v2.6_fix)?
 *
 * You can get it from World of Gothic's download section: <a href="http://www.worldofgothic.de/dl/download_278.htm" target="_blank">Report-versions: Gothic2.exe</a> (gothic2_fix-2.6.0.0-rev1.exe)
 *
 * @section faq_13 I'm a beginner, can I use G2Ext?
 *
 * Unfortunately, working with G2Ext requires good/advanced C++ programming skills and basic knowledge of reverse engineering.
 * G2Ext has not been made for beginners. Just to make life for engine modders (and those who are interested in it) easier.
 * In case, that you're a beginner, you can still try doing something simple with G2Ext. It will just take time.
 *
 * @section faq_14 Are there any tutorials/How to get started with G2Ext?
 *
 * Please take a look at the '@link getting_started Getting started @endlink' section.
 *
 * @section faq_15 What do I need to use G2Ext?
 *
 * Its recommended to use Visual C++ 2008 Express and IDA (The Interactive Disassembler) 4.9 Free for your modding purposes.<br />
 * Alternatively, you can use OllyDbg as disassembler. You will also need some good C++ skills.
 *
 * @note Other compilers than MSVC are not (and <i>won't</i> be) supported.<br />
 *
 * Get Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/" target="_blank">here</a><br />
 * Get IDA 4.9 free (recommended) <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/idadownfreeware.htm" target="_blank">here</a><br />
 * Get OllyDbg <a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/" target="_blank">here</a><br />
 *
 * @section faq_16 Do I have to pay anything for using G2Ext?
 *
 * Absolutely nothing. Zero, null, nix, naada.
 *
 * @section faq_17 Can I make a commercial mod based on G2Ext?
 *
 * No. The licences used for G2Ext (GPLv3/CC) forbid that. And if you ask me, Piranha Bytes or JoWood wouldn't like to see commercial mods for their games either...
 *
 * @section faq_18 Is G2Ext being officially supported by Piranha Bytes and/or JoWood?
 *
 * No. This is a private project made by some totally mad people, who have nothing else to do in their free time. ;]
 *
 * @section faq_19 Can you make me a sandwich?
 * 
 * Ummm... no?
