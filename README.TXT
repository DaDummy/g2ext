THE PROJECT

Usually, modifications of the engine of a game are literally impossible (for most mortal people at least *g*).
Unfortunatelly, this is also the case with the engine of Gothic II TNotR. The ZenGin.
There are lots of people, that want to modify the engine, so that their mods have unique features which are 
not being limited by a more or less very simple script system and a load of bugs. Unfortunatelly they mostly lack of 
the needed programming and the essential reverse engineering skills.

To do at least a little bit against that problem and to open up the engine to the modders to create at least 
simple engine modifications, we have created G2Ext.

G2Ext features a set of the most important headers and a loader which loads and executes the mod dlls.
It is also planned to give it some "new features" (f.e new sound system, etc.), but that is another story.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

We tried our best to contact every licencor/owner of Gothic/the ZenGin. Unfortunatelly, we were unable to
reach the Mad Scientists.
In case any Mad Scientist (Ulf Wohlers, Dieter Hildebrandt, Bert Speckels) has something against our project and/or
even wants us to stop developing/publish G2Ext, please send a mail to: c.anselm@paindevs.com
